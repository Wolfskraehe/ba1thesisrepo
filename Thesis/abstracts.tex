{\Large\bfseries Abstract}
\end{center}
Artificial immune systems are together with neural nets and genetic algorithms an important part of the bio-inspired approaches in machine learning. This thesis will examine artificial immune systems and their performance in solving the traveling salesman problem. The CLONALG algorithm will be compared to a more conventional heuristic greedy algorithm. The results will show that the clonal algorithms can achieve better results under certain circumstances but are in their general form not as efficient as the heuristic algorithm. The CLONALG and most clonal selection algorithm work with static parameters. This thesis examines also if parameter control is beneficial in solving the traveling salesman problem and shows that dynamic adaptation of certain parameters during runtime, can enhance the performance of the algorithm.
