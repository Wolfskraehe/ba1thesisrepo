{\Large\bfseries Abstract}
\end{center}

This thesis will examine the performance of artificial immune system algorithms, based on the clonal selection principle in solving traveling salesman problems. The CLONALG algorithm will be compared to a more conventional heuristic greedy algorithm. Furthermore variants with adaptive parameter control of the CLONALG will be compared to the original CLONALG. The results will show that the clonal algorithms can achieve better results under certain circumstances but are in their general form not as efficient as the heuristic algorithm. This thesis examines also if parameter control is beneficial in solving traveling salesman problems.
