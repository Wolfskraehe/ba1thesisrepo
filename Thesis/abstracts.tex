{\Large\bfseries Abstract}
\end{center}
This thesis will examine artificial immune systems and their performance in solving traveling salesman problems. The CLONALG algorithm will be compared to a more conventional heuristic greedy algorithm. The results will show that the clonal algorithms can achieve better results under certain circumstances but are in their general form not as efficient as the heuristic algorithm. The CLONALG and most clonal selection algorithm work with static parameters. This thesis examines also if parameter control is beneficial in solving traveling salesman problems and shows that dynamic adaptation of certain parameters can enhance the performance of the algorithm.
