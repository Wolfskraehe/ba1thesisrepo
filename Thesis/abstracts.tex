{\Large\bfseries Abstract}
\end{center}
Artificial immune systems are, along with neural nets and genetic algorithms, an important part of the bio-inspired approaches in machine learning. This thesis examines artificial immune systems and their performance in solving the traveling salesman problem. The CLONALG algorithm is compared to a more conventional greedy algorithm. Comparison shows that the clonal algorithms can achieve better results under certain circumstances but are, in their general form, not as efficient as the greedy algorithm. The CLONALG and most clonal selection algorithms work with static parameters. This thesis examines if parameter control is beneficial in solving the traveling salesman problem and shows that dynamic adaptation of certain parameters during runtime can enhance performance of the algorithm.
