\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:intro}

Bio-inspired approaches in machine learning mimic biological functions and concepts like the information exchange of neurons in the human brain or the evolution of genes through selection. The biological system often has efficient methods for learning and adaptation, therefore bio-inspired approaches in machine learning were successful over the past years. The immune system got more attention in the computational intelligence field over the last 20 years \cite{tan2016artificial}.\\\\
The biological immune system has a number of desireable traits for learning in computational science as discussed in chapter \ref{chap:bis}. These traits can be used in algorithms to build an artificial immune system for solving a wide range of problems as shown in chapter \ref{chap:ais}. The artificial immune system can be applied to the same fields as neural nets or genetic algorithms, but are also efficient in combination with these algorithms \cite{Pasti06}. One of the  application fields is the traveling salesman problem. The artificial immune system has been successfully applied to the TSP by \cite{DEC02} and \cite{sun}. This thesis focuses on the overall performance of the AIS in solving the TSP, especially compared to a more conventional method. The artificial immune system works with different approaches taken from the biological immune system. One of these approaches is clonal selection which was formalized into an algorithm by \cite{DEC02}. In chapter \ref{chap:eva} this algorithm termed CLONALG will be applied to a set of TSP.\\
The CLONALG is originally a static algorithm with fixed parameters. The work of \cite{RIFF09} and \cite{Garret04} has shown that by dynamically changing these parameters the performance of the algorithm can be enhanced. In chapter \ref{chap:eva} a tuned CLONALG and a variant with dynamic parameter control will be applied to the same set of TSP and evaluated.\\\\
The thesis aims to examine if the AIS is able to achieve good results in solving the TSP and especially which circumstances and parameters within a clonal selection algorithm are responsible for a good performance.
